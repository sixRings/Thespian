1
00:00:04,626 --> 00:00:05,554
Are you tired of

2
00:00:05,617 --> 00:00:06,681
bulky old vacuum cleaners?

3
00:00:06,981 --> 00:00:07,743
Ouch!

4
00:00:07,768 --> 00:00:09,070
I've had it with this old thing.

5
00:00:09,321 --> 00:00:10,734
There must be a better way!

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,164
Oh, but there is!

7
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,860
Meet Alex!

8
00:00:14,118 --> 00:00:15,975
The space aged cleaning solution!

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,721
Alex knows how to clean those

10
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:18,823
hard to reach places!

11
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,200
I won't be needing this anymore!

12
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:23,161
No! you won't.

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,210
Because Alex is

14
00:00:24,723 --> 00:00:26,927
the future of clean!

15
00:00:27,723 --> 00:00:28,507
Cut!

16
00:00:28,747 --> 00:00:29,656
That's a wrap, folks!

17
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:31,093
Let's call it a day.

18
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:35,107
Achoo!

19
00:00:35,132 --> 00:00:35,849
Yikes!

20
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:36,721
Gazuntite!

21
00:00:37,014 --> 00:00:38,660
Pardon me, Sorry to disturb you, sir.

22
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,158
The name's Alex.

23
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:41,575
Oh, I know who you are.

24
00:00:42,002 --> 00:00:42,903
My name is Tumbo,

25
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:44,490
and I'm a huge fan!

26
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:45,575
Oh, really, Tumbo?

27
00:00:45,654 --> 00:00:46,552
Oh, seriously...

28
00:00:46,606 --> 00:00:48,575
You've got all these modes, no cord!

29
00:00:48,645 --> 00:00:49,505
You got arms!

30
00:00:49,535 --> 00:00:50,847
You're so cool!

31
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:52,919
They don't call me "the future of clean" for noth...

32
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:54,524
...ing.

33
00:00:54,656 --> 00:00:55,587
I had to clean that up.

34
00:00:55,841 --> 00:00:56,891
You were saying?

35
00:00:57,227 --> 00:00:58,450
I think you were saying

36
00:00:58,505 --> 00:00:59,798
that I was amazing. I was gonna say...

37
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,805
Achoo!

38
00:01:01,825 --> 00:01:02,743
Gazuntite.

39
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:05,188
Oh well,

40
00:01:05,382 --> 00:01:08,351
- I'm a little clogged up.
- You know, you might wanna hold off on the vacuuming.

41
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:09,579
- Achoo!
- Gazuntite.

42
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:11,187
Because everytime you vacuum.

43
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:12,844
- Achoo!
- Gazuntite.

44
00:01:12,923 --> 00:01:14,189
You sneeze back out.

45
00:01:14,377 --> 00:01:15,329
- Achoo!
- Gazuntite.

46
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,540
You're not listening.

47
00:01:16,854 --> 00:01:17,868
Pay attention to me!

48
00:01:17,901 --> 00:01:18,860
Achoo!

49
00:01:20,377 --> 00:01:21,480
Gazuntite.

50
00:01:22,657 --> 00:01:24,011
I am so sorry Alex!

51
00:01:24,254 --> 00:01:25,222
Le-Let me get that.

52
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,926
Wow...

53
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:28,852
Awesome!

54
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:29,954
Okay, Tumbo!

55
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:31,660
What do you say, we have some quiet time.

56
00:01:31,852 --> 00:01:33,204
Great idea, Alex.

57
00:01:33,672 --> 00:01:35,602
Some vacuums are super loud...

58
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:37,126
and I'm like put a sock in it.

59
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,452
Except, not literally...

60
00:01:38,624 --> 00:01:40,079
a sock in a tube would restrict...

61
00:01:40,104 --> 00:01:40,987
- air flow and...
-Tumbo.

62
00:01:41,577 --> 00:01:42,485
Quiet time.

63
00:01:43,682 --> 00:01:44,923
Alright. Yeah, Okay

64
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,219
Oops..

65
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:52,082
Oh, I got it.

66
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,626
No no no no no! Allow me!

67
00:01:53,827 --> 00:01:55,113
No no! But it's my responsiblity.

68
00:01:55,153 --> 00:01:56,696
- It's my pleasure!
- But I insist...

69
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,450
But I said...

70
00:01:57,475 --> 00:01:59,450
it's my pleasure!

71
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,657
Ah, That's better!

72
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,212
I can't move, Alex.

73
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,584
I guess that why...

74
00:02:04,623 --> 00:02:06,135
I'm the future of clean...

75
00:02:06,307 --> 00:02:07,629
...not you!

76
00:02:08,313 --> 00:02:09,251
I got it.

77
00:02:09,574 --> 00:02:10,491
Uh-oh.

78
00:02:11,196 --> 00:02:12,484
Hold it! Hold it in, Tumbo!

79
00:02:12,547 --> 00:02:13,326
Hold it in!

80
00:02:23,238 --> 00:02:24,480
Gazuntite.

81
00:02:27,136 --> 00:02:28,047
Hey, Alex!

82
00:02:28,227 --> 00:02:29,159
Yeah, Tumbo?

83
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,442
No sneezing.

84
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:32,005
You fixed my clogs!

85
00:02:33,036 --> 00:02:34,637
Glad that I could help, buddy.
